# Overview

The purpose of this doc is for anything necessary to discuss, document or communicate about Vite and/or Vitest configuration, development, build processes or best practices.

The initial purpose also serves as a placeholder file for the new subfolder config structure as `git` requires at least one file inside a directory or it will not commit the directory to the repo either.
